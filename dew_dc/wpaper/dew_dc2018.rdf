Title: Cuban Demography And Economic Consequences
Abstract: This paper highlights and explains the effects of various demographic shocks to the Cuban economy, starting from the baby boom of the early 1960s and the collapse in fertility rates thereafter. The primary contribution is a freely available Excel workbook, PopPyrCuba.xlsm, that enables projections of population age distributions. For Cuba, the future looks bleak. Japan and other rich countries are finding that demographic forces are quite strong and cause serious economic harm. Without a developed market system, Cuba’s economy offers little protection from the coming storm. There are, of course, many challenges facing post-Castro Cuba, but demography may prove to be the most daunting of all.

Title: Accessing IRS Form 990 Data with Excel
Abstract: Form990.xlsm is a freely available, standalone, macro-enabled Excel workbook that allows users to easily download and analyze IRS Form 990 tax data for nonprofits. This information is extremely difficult to access in machine-readable format, but the IRS recently made the data available as XML files. Form990.xlsm directly imports data in separate sheets for each institution. This paper demonstrates how to use this tool by analyzing a small sample of private, selective liberal arts colleges. We compare Form 990 data with IPEDS and find substantial agreement, but important differences. Endowments were different by more than 5% in 7 of 46 observations. Student FTEs had a greater than 5% difference in 22 out 46 schools (several were over 20%). Form 990 data offer researchers an alternative to IPEDS that is arguably of higher quality.

Title: Entrepreneurial Discovery Capital
Abstract: This paper identifies how capital losses are unavoidably incurred in the discovery of viable entrepreneurial ventures. Losses are proportional to the novelty and perceived profit potential of a prospective venture, exemplified by the high risk/high return nature of high technology start-ups. Venture capitalists internalize the costs and benefits of this discovery process, and set up portfolios where the majority of funded ventures unavoidably fail or earn subpar returns. They incur these losses in order to discover the one Winner venture whose outsize returns will compensate for the capital losses in the failed ventures. The investment in failing ventures is unavoidable and necessary to discover the Winner because the winning business model cannot be determined ex ante. I call this investment “Entrepreneurial Discovery Capital.” This paper hypothesizes that many industry and economy-wide cycles may be the result of such a process that occurs at a much larger scale than a single fund. Venture capital in microcosm provides a model of an economy-wide process where the decisions of myriad market participants are coordinated “as if by an invisible hand” by signals from the capital markets.
