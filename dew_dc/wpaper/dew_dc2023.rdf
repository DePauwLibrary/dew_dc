Title: One-shot Economic Mobility via Microsoft Excel
Abstract: This paper explains how to use a macro-enabled Excel workbook, Mobility.xlsm, to teach basic concepts about intergenerational mobility as a standalone, one-time class or assignment at the undergraduate level. The focus is on explaining the results from Chetty et al. (2014) which tracks the parentâ€™s place in the income distribution and then their adult childrenâ€™s income ranking. Simulation is used to explain the bottom-to-top transition probability and the transition matrix with strong visuals and concrete numbers. The workbook is entirely self-contained and has a series of questions to lead students through the material. This paper has suggested answers and further areas of study. Download the freely-available Excel workbook at tiny.cc/mobilityexcel.
